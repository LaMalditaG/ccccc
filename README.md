ComputerCraft Create Contraption Compatibility

## What?

Basically, this mod allows CC-Tweaked's computers to work when they are part of a Create Contraption. There are also some peripherals that are compatible:
- Speaker
- Wireless Modem
- Disk Drive

Every compatible peripheral inside the contraption can be accessed by a computer in the same contraption no matter where they are, so they don't have to be next to each other.
These peripherals will be accessed by a fake peripheral hub inside the computer.

## TODO
- Other CC-Tweaked peripherals
  - Printer
  - Display (we'll see...)
- Chests and other containers
- Turtles
- Update block textures when the blockstate changes
